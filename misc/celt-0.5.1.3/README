CELT is a very low delay audio codec designed for high-quality
communications.  Its potential uses include video-conferencing and
network music performance.  This is a maintained branch of the 0.5.1
prerelease of CELT.  

THIS 0.5.1-X PRERELEASE IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH ANY PREVIOUS OR
SUBSEQUENT NUMBERED RELEASE.

0.5.0 aand before as well as 0.5.2 and later use a different API, a
different ABI and a different bitstream format.  Only other
prereleases on this 0.5.1 branch are code, binary or stream compatable
with this version.

To compile:
% ./configure
% make

To test the encoder:
% testcelt <rate> <channels> <frame size> <bytes per packet> input.sw output.sw

...where input.sw is a 16-bit (machine endian) audio file sampled at
44.1 kHz or 48 kHz. The output file is already decompressed.  the
<rate> parameter is the number of bytes per packet to use.

Alternatively, there are now Ogg-based tools in tools/. Use the --help
option for details. These are quite similar to the speexenc/speexdec
tools. Note that these tools should be used for
_testing_purposes_only_; the bitstream format used by CELT-0.5.1 has
already been altered in subsequent releases.  Files produced by
celtenc051 will not be supported by later releases of celt.  They will
work only with releasein this 0.5.1 branch, and will not be supported
in the larger Ogg frameworks.
